This week has been better.  I'm actually back in the so called groove and routines are returning back to 'normal'.  I have been involved in a number of things to improve our Product team.  These include some really philosophical questions such as 'What is product?' but some basic product activities such as prioritisation.  We also held our 13th Product Leaders Meetup and I have to say each one of these sessions get better and better.

## Product prioritisation... Art or Science?

Our retro last week, concluded that we should take stock on the remaining six month of the financial year and check that the things we are doing deliver the most valuable outcomes for right amount of effort.  You always read in product related blogs and books that prioritisation is a fundamental attribute for a product person but it's funny how on the ground the breadth and consistency to which this occurs.  In an ideal world each problem you're solving can be justified and what you want to try to avoid in most cases is 'gut' instinct.  It's a very fine balance of being creative and using your previous experience to determine what next vs some sort data driven approach that can objective each initiative relative to one another.  On one hand, if you go too data driven you take out some of the fun from your product because it can be too labour intensive and time consuming vs being too much based on a 'whim' and increase the risk in the product failing.  In later posts and weeknotes, I explore the idea of Art vs Science more in the product management lifecycle.  As for product prioritisation, it appears a little more of a data driven approach can be helpful for number of reasons:

1. Transparency in how the product backlog and roadmap is constructed
2. You can take various data points and objectively see what the most important thing to work
3. As you run through a number of sprints, your able to take learnings and feed this back into into the next round of prioritisation.  

As a team, we took the decision to utilisation the RICE prioritisation  approach.  This is based on the broad principle of 'more value, for less effort'.  This approach takes a number of inputs that you can then use in a simple math formula to create a prioritisation score.  Usually the higher the score, the higher the priority that problem or initiative needs to be addressed.  RICE stands for:

* **R**each = How many users will this problem or initiative impact?
* **I**mpact = What value does this problem or initiative deliver?
* **C**onfidence = How certain will the value be delivered when the problem is solved?
* **E**ffort = What effort is required to solve this problem?



So the math equation to work out the Priority score is:



**Priority score = (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort**



This framwork give you quite a lot of flexibility and you can tailor the respective definitions based upon what is important for customers and what is important for customers.  For example, if you have more that one 'Impact' metric you're able to priority what is more important by adding an additional 





## A community run by product leaders for product leaders

This week we ran our virtual product leaders meetup.  This is our third virtual meeting....

## Non work stuff

This week was the monthly Whisky tasting with a band of merry people spread across the across the country.  This is our fifth tasting together and having formed during COVID-19, we haven't yet physically met each other before. It's a very good excuse to take time out and meet other people and get to know them more.  Obviously getting a little merry with our four drams is fun but discovering the different types of whiskey out there and share that experience has been amazing.  We're lucky enough that a couple of our members know their whisky / whiskey and treat novices like me as their students.  I've learnt so much, especially taking the time to reconsider whisky tasted previously and going back to it for second change.  My taste for whisky has changed over the past few years and definitely thought I like this whisky now compared to when I originally tasted it and thought "This is not for me".

September is the new start of the year and what better month to start my week notes. I’ve just got back from a long and restful two week holiday and came back to a four day working week. As the summer days dwindle and life gets back to a little bit of normality, it’s clear that that we’re all moving onto a new phase.  But this week that new phase will need a bit of a kick start... it’s been a hard week to get back in the groove. The number of times I forgotten to do things are not being able to finish a piece of work when I expected I would shows that having break doesn’t always give you that rejuvenation! It might also just be my old age starting to kick in. I’ve also had a conversation with myself that that it’s ok not to be at the top of you game all the time.


## Time for a retro


At work we're coming up to the half way point of the financial year (FY20/21) and that means taking time out to reflect and what needs to be for the rest of the year.  In our retro we discussed what we learnt from the first wave of COVID-19. 

Here were some of the findings:

- Context: Just before lockdown started, our team had just formed and then we were plunged straight into handling the pandemic
- Tensions were high and felt we weren’t performing at the the time. People’s wellbeing and supporting each other is vital
- Implicitly trusting one another is key in a crisis. It’s very difficult to look back on decisions made in an fast paced evolving situation 
- We proved that our role was critical to the wider team and customers, so much so that we were asked to accelerate our ambitions
- Finally, we need to take the time back and spend time ‘forming’ as a team. The pandemic forced us all into much more of a ‘storming’ phase.  If you’re familiar with [Tucker’s stages of group development](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development), it’s necessary to go through all stages in order for a team to grow, face up to challenges, tackle problems, find solutions, plan work, and deliver results. 

Standing back, there was a realisation that we did the best we could in a unique moment that we will remember for the rest of our lives.  We’re not in a bad place after all.  As the wise of saying goes ‘Crises brings the best and worst out of us’. I think that sums it up very nicely.

Looking forward, we decided to take stock of what we are doing for the next 6 months. More about this in future posts.


## A community run by product leaders for product leaders

I’m also prepping for Product Leaders Meet-up. This is where our Senior Product Owners (SPOs) get together every six weeks to discuss how we do we do Product Management better. Our role as Product Leaders is to enable product teams to make brilliant products. We have a great set of enthusiastic SPOs behinds the scene helping. I love how we have (slowly) created an engaged community and willing to participate, learn and have a bit of fun too!


## Non work stuff

The kids are going back to school. Eldest is eager to start Year 2 and getting up to mischiefs with friends. We have our youngest starting the same school in Reception year. I have to give a lot of admiration to both of them as they have showed a lot of resilience coping and adapting to all the change that COVID-19 has caused.

At the start of our 2 week holiday my wife, Alex, got her promotion to a Peadiatric Consultant at our local hospital. I’m very proud about what she has achieved and we call finally say after 20 years of hard graft and raising two kids at the same time that she won’t be known as a ‘Junior doctor’. It’s given us more certainty about our future and we can start to think about what next for our family.

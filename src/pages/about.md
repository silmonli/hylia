Currently, I’m working for BT in the Consumer Digital department as a Digital Product Strategist for the BT, EE and Plusnet brand.

Over the past 15 years, I’ve had the privilege to work with a number of well known organisations including Carphone Warehouse, O2 Telefónica, Lloyds Banking Group, Barclaycard, The Co-Op and The Department of Work and Pensions developing and executing customer initiatives across traditional and emerging channels.

I’m really passionate about understanding customer needs and solving these with new tech and ways of working. I’ve always wanted to make a positive impact and I use my mum and dad as the litmus test of my progression in the work I do.

I coach product people to be the best they can be, focusing more of their time and effort on product strategy development, a ‘build, measure, learn‘ experimental mindset, and always think outcomes over outputs.

You can talk to me about:

- Creating and effectively communicating a product vision and strategy 
- Inspirational goal setting (OKRs)
- Alignment on problems to solve
- How to prioritise things

For most of my childhood I spent alot of time as a gymnast and acrobatics, representing Great Britain in a number of European competitions. I now like to snowboard, play golf and spend time with friends & family.

The way I work and live:

- Never stop growing or learning
- Do what you say you will do
- Always do your best
- Be kind and helpful
- Listen. Especially to kids, they are very smart people.

I always welcome sharing experiences and constructive feedback.  If you're interested in talking, the quickest way to reach me is:
